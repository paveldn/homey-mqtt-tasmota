Tasmota MQTT

This lightweight Homey device application adds tasmota devices support through MQTT protocol. It uses Menno van Grinsven's MQTT Client to communicate with MQTT broker, so client should be already installed and configured.
Current version of application supports onoff and power monitoring capabilities for single or multiple sockets devices.

This is a clone of the original where I've fixed the power measure functionality
